There are several open-source tools available for monitoring Docker instances. These tools can help you track container performance, resource usage, health checks, and more. Here are some popular open-source solutions:

Prometheus:

Prometheus is a leading open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It's highly flexible and can monitor various aspects of your Docker containers.
You can install Prometheus and use it to scrape metrics from Docker using exporters like the Node Exporter, cAdvisor, etc.
Grafana can be used in conjunction with Prometheus to visualize the collected data.
cAdvisor (Container Advisor):

cAdvisor is an open-source container monitoring tool that automatically collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers.
It provides information about resource usage and performance characteristics of containers.
Grafana:

Grafana, although not a monitoring tool itself, can be integrated with various data sources, including Prometheus and InfluxDB, and it's excellent for visualizing metrics in dashboards.
Netdata:

Netdata is another powerful, open-source, real-time performance monitoring tool for systems and containers.
It provides detailed insights into metrics, including CPU, memory, disk, network, and more.
Here's a simple example of using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor Docker containers:

Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from Docker containers using exporters like cAdvisor.
Configure Grafana to connect with Prometheus as a data source and create dashboards to visualize container metrics.
For a more comprehensive monitoring system, you might want to consider combining multiple tools. For example, Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and maybe cAdvisor for specific container-level details.

The installation and configuration steps for each tool are specific and can be a bit involved. However, each of these tools has extensive documentation available on their respective websites, which provides detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and integration.
